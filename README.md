# MapGenerationProject

This project is a procedural hex map generator built with Unity, based on the excellent tutorials by [Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/).

While following these tutorials as a foundation, this project aims to go a step further by improving performance and scalability using Unity's **Job System**, and eventually migrating to **ECS (Entity Component System)** for full data-oriented design.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

This project is currently under active development and includes both faithful reproductions of the original tutorial content and custom improvements. The focus is on:

- âœ… Procedural hex grid generation  
- âœ… Terrain editing and mesh manipulation  
- ðŸ”„ Refactoring for multithreaded performance using **Unity Jobs**  
- ðŸ”œ Future integration with **Unity ECS**  

## Goals

- Learn and replicate the fundamentals of procedural hex map generation
- Explore Unityâ€™s Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)
- Make the system scalable and performant for large maps

## Resources

- ðŸ“š Original tutorials: [Catlike Coding - Hex Map Series](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/)
